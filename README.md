mailgun4s 
============

Updated project originally forked from https://github.com/Nycto/mailgun-scala but since has been completely re-written.

A Scala wrapper around the Mailgun API. Their documentation can
be found here:

http://documentation.mailgun.com

Currently only supports sending messages, but more functionality will be added as needed or requested.

Example
-------

The following example shows how to instantiate and send an email:

```scala
import org.matthicks.mailgun._
import java.io._
import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val mailgun = new Mailgun("samples.mailgun.org", "key-YOUR-MAILGUN-KEY")
val response = mailgun.send(Message.simple(
  from = EmailAddress("nobody@example.com", "Test App"),
  to = EmailAddress("mailgun-scala@mailinator.com", "Joe User"),
  "Mailgun4s Rules!",
  text = "This is the testing text",
  html = "<html><b>This</b> <i>seems</i> <img src=\"cid:example.jpg\"/> to <h1>work!</h1></html>"
).withInline(new File("example.jpg"), "image/jpeg"))

val result = Await.result(response, Duration.Inf)
println(s"Result: $result")
```

Adding it to your Project
-------------------------

Add the following directives to your `build.sbt` file:

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "org.matthicks" %% "mailgun4s" % "1.0.15"
)
```
